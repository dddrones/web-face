# vibe with it. feel it.

This microsite with webcam functionality gives the user a psychadelic experience. As you move your head from side to side and up and down, the colours and sizes and shapes all change and fade away as if they were never even there. The red eyes stare back into yours as you feel the flow, feel the vibe, and ride the wave. Adding to the experience is a mood button that, when pressed, should present you with the perfect music to suit the vibe.
